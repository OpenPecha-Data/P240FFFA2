[Chapter] 19: An Analysis of Time (kala) (time)1. If “the present” and “future” exist presupposing
“the past,”“The present” and “future” will exist in “the past.”

2. If “the present” and “future” did not exist there [in “the past”],How could “the present”
and “future” exist presupposing that “past?

3. Without presupposing “the past” the two things [“the present” and “future”] cannot be proved
to exist.Therefore neither present nor future time exist.

4. In this way the remaining two [times] can be inverted.Thus one would regard “highest,” “lowest”
and “middle,” etc., as oneness and difference. (or “after,” “before” and “middle”,
or “right,” “left” and “middle” …)

5. A non-stationary “time” cannot be “grasped”; and a stationary “time” which can be grasped
does not exist.How, then, can one perceive time if it is not “grasped”?

6. Since time is dependent on a thing (bhava), how can time [exist] without a thing?There is
not any thing which exists; how, then, will time become [something]?
