[Chapter] 4: An Analysis of the “Groups of Universal Elements” (skandhas) (the aggregates)1.
Visible form (rūpa) is not perceived without the basic cause of visible form (rūpakāraṇa);Likewise
the basic cause of visible form does not appear without the visible form.

2. If the visible form existed apart from its basic cause, it would logically follow that visible
form is without cause;But there is nothing anywhere [arising] without cause.

3. On the other hand, if there would be a basic cause apart from visible form,The basic cause
would be without any product; but there is no basic cause without a product.

4. Just as when there is visible form no basic cause of form obtains,So when there is no visible
form no basic cause of form obtains.

5. Furthermore, it does not obtain that no visible form exists without a basic cause,One should
not construe any constructs concerning the form.

6. Just as it does not obtain that the product is the same as the cause,So it does not obtain
that product is not the same as the cause.

7. Also, sensation, thought, mental conception, conditioned elements (saṃskāra) andAll “things”
(bhāva) are to be dealt with in the same way as visible form.

8. Whoever argues against “emptiness” in order to refute an argument,For him everything, including
the point of contention (sādhya) is known to be unrefuted.

9. Whoever argues by means of “emptiness” in order to explain an understanding,For him, everything
including the point to be proved (sādhya) is known to be misunderstood.
