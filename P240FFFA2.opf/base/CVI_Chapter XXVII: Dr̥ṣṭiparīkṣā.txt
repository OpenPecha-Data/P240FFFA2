[Chapter] 27: An Analysis of the Views (drsti) About Reality (dogmas)1. Those [views] relating
to the limits of the past reality are: “The world is eternal,” etc.,[And “I have existed
in the past,” “I have not existed in the past,” etc.]

2. The assertion: “I will not become something different in a future time,”“I will become [something
different],” and the alternative, etc., are relating to an end [in the future].

3. [The assertion:] “I existed in a past time (1)” does not obtain,Since this [present being]
is not (i.e. “ii” is not the same as “i”) that one who [was] in a former birth.

4. Were he [in a previous birth], that individual self (ātma) which he acquires [in coming into
existence] would be different.Moreover, what kind of individual self is there without
acquisition (upadana)?

5. If it were held that: “There is no individual self without the acquisition,”Then the individual
self would be [only] the acquisition or it is not an individual self [at all].

6. The individual self is not the acquisition, since that [acquisition] appears and disappears.Now
really, how will “he who acquires” become “that which is acquired?

7. Moreover, it does not obtain that the individual self is different from the acquisition.If
the individual self were different, it would be perceived without the acquisition; but [in
fact] it is not so perceived.

8. Thus that [individual self] is not different from nor identical to the acquisition.The individual
self is not without acquisition; but there is no certainty that “It does not exist.”

9. [The assertion:] “I have not existed in a past time (2)” does not obtain,For that one [now
living] is not different (i.e. “ii” is not different than “i”) from that one who was in
a former birth.

10. If that [present person] were different, he would exist in exclusion of that [former] one.Therefore
either that [former person] persists, or he would be born eternal!

11. 1

12. There is no existing thing which is “that which has not existed prior.” Therefore, the error
logically follows thatEither the individual self is “what is produced” or it originates
without a cause.

13. Thus the view concerning the past which [asserts] “I have existed (1),” or “I have not existed
(2),”Both [“existed and not existed”] (3) or neither (4): this does not obtain at all.

14. [The views:] “I will become something in a future time (1′),”Or “I will not become (2′)
[something],” etc. (3′) (4′), [should be considered] like those [views] of the past.

15. If “This is a man, this is a god” [obtains], then eternity (i) exists,For god is unproduced,
and certainly something eternal would not be born.

16. If man is different from god, there would exist something non-eternal (ii).If man is different
from god, then a continuity does not obtain.(i.e. they cannot be different)

17. If one part were divine and another part human, (i.e. a man with an eternal soul)Then there
would be something non-eternal [together with] that which is eternal (iii); but that is
not possible.

18. If something both non-eternal and eternal were proved,Then, no doubt, something “neither
eternal nor non-eternal (iv)” is proved.

19. If someone, having come from somewhere, in some way goes somewhere again,Then there would
be existence-in-flux with no beginning; but this is not the case.

20. If someone who is eternal does not exist, who will exist being non-eternal,Or who being
both eternal and non-eternal, or devoid of these two [characteristics]?

21. If the world would come to an end, how would an other-world come into existence?If the world
would not come to an end, how would an other-world come into being?

22. Since the continuity of the “groups of universal elements” (skandhas) [from one moment to
the next] functions like flames of lamps,[The view:] “both having an end and not having
an end” is not possible.

23. If the former [“groups”] would disappear, those [new] “groups” which are dependent on those
[former] “groups” would not arise;Therefore, the world would come to an end (ii).

24. If the former [“groups”] would not disappear, these [new] “groups” which are dependent on
those [former] “groups” would not arise;Therefore, the world would be eternal (i).

25. If one part were finite and the other were infinite,The world would be both finite and infinite
(iii); but this is not possible.

26. Therefore, how can it be that one part of “one who acquires” [karma] will be destroyed,
(i.e. the body – man?)And one part not destroyed? (i.e. the very subtle mind — the divine
part?) This is not possible.

27. How, indeed, can it be that one part of the acquisition [of karma] (i.e. the learning stored
in the body) will be destroyed,And one part not destroyed? (i.e. the learning stored
in the mind) That, certainly does not obtain.

28. If the [view] “both finite and infinite” were proved,Then no doubt, “neither finite nor
infinite” (i.e. nothing at all) could be proved.

29. Because of the emptiness of all existing things,How will the views about “eternity,” etc.,
come into existence, about what, of whom, and of what kind?

30. To him, possessing compassion, who taught the real dharmaFor the destruction of all views—to
him, Gautama, I humbly offer reverence.
