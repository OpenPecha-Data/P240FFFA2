[Chapter] 3: An Analysis of “Vision” and Other Sense-Faculties (the sense-fields)1. Vision,
hearing, smelling, tasting, touching and thoughtAre the six sense faculties.The area of their
concern is that which is seen [heard, smelled] and so forth.

2. Certainly vision does not in any way see its own self.Now if it does not see its own self,
how can it possibly see something else?

3. An understanding of vision is not attained through the example of fire [which, itself, burns].On
the contrary, that [example of fire] together with vision is refuted by [the analysis
of] “present going to,” “that which is already gone to,” and “that which is not yet gone
to.” (in Chapter 2)

4. When no vision occurs, nothing whatsoever is being seen.How, then, is it possible to say:
Vision sees?

5. Therefore, vision does not see, and “no-vision” does not see.Nevertheless, it is explained
that also the “seer” is to be known only by his vision.

6. There is no “seer” with vision or without vision;Therefore, if there is no “seer,” how can
there be vision and the object seen?

7. As the birth of a son is said to occur presupposing the mother and the father,Knowledge is
said to occur presupposing the eye being dependent on the visible forms.

8. Since the “object seen” and the vision do not exist (independently, on their own), there
is no four-fold [consequence]: knowledge, etc. [cognitive sensation, affective sensation,
and “desire”].Also, then, how will the acquisition (upadāna) [of karma] and its consequences
[i.e., existence, birth, aging, and death] be produced?

9. [Likewise] hearing, smelling, tasting, touching and thought are explained as vision.Indeed
one should not apprehend the “hearer,” “what is heard,” etc. [as self-existent entities].
