[Chapter] 2: An Analysis of “Going to” (change or movement)1. [Nagarjuna:] That which is already
gone to (gatam – goer after the going – iii) is not that which is “being gone to” (gamyate);
more so, “that which is not yet gone to” (agatam – goer before the going – i) is certainly
not that “being gone to.” (gamyate)Also, the “present going to” (gamyamāna – actual
goer – ii) without “that which is already gone to” and “that which is not yet gone to”
is not “being gone to”.

2. [An opponent objects:]Where there is activity (ceṣṭa – visible activity) there is a “process
of going” (gatis – real going process), and that activity (visible activity) is in the
“present going to” (gamyamāne – ii).Then “process of going” (gatis – real going process)
is inherent in the “present going to” (gamyamāne – ii) [since] the activity (visible activity)
is not in “that which is already gone to” (iii) nor in “that which is not yet gone to.”
(i)

3. [Nagarjuna answers:]How will the “act of going” (gamanam – visible activity & displacement)
of “present going to” (gamyamāna – ii) be produced,Since both kinds of the “act of going”
(visible activity & displacement) [as applied to an active process and to the activity
of going through space] simply are not produced (i.e. originating) in the “present going to”
(ii)?

4. Having the “act of going” (gamanam – visible activity & displacement) of “present going to”
(gamyamānasya – ii) has necessarily resulted in a lack of “the present going to” (ii) of
the “process of going” (gati – real going process),For the “present going to” (gamyamāna
– ii) is the “being gone to” (gamyate).

5. [Recognizing] the “act of going” (visible activity & displacement) of “present going to”
(ii) results in two [kinds of] “acts of going” (gamanadvaya – visible activity & displacement):One
by which there is “present going to” (gamyamāna – ii), the other which is the “act
of going” (gamana – visible activity & displacement).

6. Two “goers” (gantarau) would fallaciously follow as a consequence of two “acts of going,”
(visible activity & displacement)Since certainly the “act of going” (visible activity & displacement)
is not produced without a “goer”.

7. If there is no going (gamana) (i.e. gamana = “act of going”) without a “goer” (gantāra),How
will the “goer” (gantā / self-existing subject) come into being when there is no “going”
(gamana) (i.e. gamana = “act of going”)?

8. The “goer” does not go (move); consequently a “non-goer” certainly does not go (move).What
third [possibility] goes (moves) other than the “goer” and “non-goer”?

9. It is said: “The ‘goer’ goes” (moves) How is that possible,When without the “act of going”
(gamana – visible movement) no “goer” is produced?

10. Those who hold the view that the “goer” “goes” (moves) must [falsely] concludeThat there
is a “goer” without the “act of going” (visible activity & displacement) since the “act of
going” (visible activity & displacement) is obtained (icchata) by a “goer.”

11. If the “goer” “goes” (moves), then two acts of going (visible activity & displacement) [erroneously]
follow;[One is] that by which the “going on” (gantā) is designated, and [the
second is] the real “goer” (gantā / self-existing subject) who “goes”(moves).

12. The “state of going to” (gantum) is not begun in “that which is already gone to” (gatam
– iii), nor in “that which is not yet gone to” (agatam – i);Nor is the “state of going to”
begun in “present going to” (gamyamāna – ii).Where then is it begun?

13. “Present going to” (ii) does not exist previous to the beginning of the “act of going,”
(visible activity & displacement) nor does “that which is already gone to” (iii) exist where
the “act of going” (visible activity & displacement) should begin.How can the “act of going”
(visible activity & displacement) [begin] in “that which is not yet gone to” (i)?

14. It is mentally fabricated what is “that which is already gone to” (gatam – iii), “present
going to” (gamyamāna – ii) and “that which is not yet gone to” (agatam – i);Therefore, the
beginning of the “act of going” (visible activity & displacement) is not seen in any way.

15. A “goer” does not remain unmoved (na tiṣṭati); then certainly the “non-goer” does not remain
unmoved.What third [possibility] other than “goer” and “non-goer” can thus remain unmoved?

16. It is said that a “goer” continues to be [a “goer”]. But how can that be possible,Since
a “goer”(gantā / self-existing subject) lacking the “act of going” (gamanam – visible activity
& displacement) is simply not produced?

17. [The “goer”] does not continue to be [a goer] as a result of “present going to” (ii) or
“that which is already gone to” (iii) or “that which is not yet gone to,”(i)For then the act
of going (gamana – visible activity & displacement) [would be] origination while the “process
of going” (gati – real going process) would be the same as cessation.

18. Thus it does not obtain that the "goer" is simply "what is going" (gamana).Likewise it does
not obtain that: "Then the 'goer' is something other that what is in the 'process of going'
(gatis)."

19. And if the “act of going” (visible movement) and the “goer” are identical,The fallacy logically
follows that the “person acting” (kartus) and the action (karma) are identical.

20. Alternatively, if the “goer” is different from the “process of going” (gati – – real going
process),The “act of going” (gamana – visible activity & displacement) would exist without
the “goer” and the “goer” would exist without the “act of going.” (visible activity &
displacement)

21. Neither the identity nor the essential difference is established (siddhi) regarding the
two [conceptions “goer” and “act of going” (visible activity & displacement)].If these two
[alternatives] are not established, in what way is [this problem] to be understood?

22. The “goer” is defined by that which is in the “process of going” (real going process); he
does not go to that [destination] which is determined by the “process of going” (real going
process) because there is no prior “process of going”. (gati – real going process)Indeed
someone goes somewhere.

23. The “goer” does not go to that [destination] other than that “process of going” (real going
process)- by which he is defined as “goer”,Because when one goes [somewhere] (i.e. else)
two “processes of going” (real going processes) cannot be produced.

24. A real “goer” does not motivate three kinds of “acts of going”: [real, non-real, and real-and-non-real];Nor
does a non-real [“goer”] motivate three kinds of motion.

25. Also, a real-non-real [“goer”] does not motivate three kinds of motion.Therefore, the “process
of going” (gati – real going process),the “goer” (gantā / self-existing subject) and
“a destination to be gone to” (gantavyam) do not exist (inherently).
