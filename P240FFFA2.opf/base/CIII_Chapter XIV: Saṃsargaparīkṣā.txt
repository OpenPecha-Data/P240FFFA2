[Chapter] 14: An Analysis of Unification (samsarga) (combination)1. That which is seen, sight,
and the “seer”: these threeDo not combine together either in pairs or altogether.

2. Desire, the one who desires, and the object of desire have to be regarded in the same way,[As
also] the impurities which remain and the three kinds of “base of sense” (ayatana) which
remain.

3. [Some hold:] There is unification (samsarga) of one different thing with another different
thing; [but] since the differentnessOf what is seen, etc. does not exist, those [factors]
do not enter into unification.

4. Not only does the differentness of that which is seen, etc. not exist,Also the differentness
of something coming from another does not obtain.

5. A thing is different insofar as it presupposes a second different thing.One thing is not
different from another thing without the other thing.

6. If one different thing is different from a second different thing, it exists without a second
different thing;But without a second different thing, one different thing does not exist
as a different thing.

7. Differentness does not exist in a different thing, nor in what is not different.When differentness
does not exist, then there is neither what is different nor “this” [from which something
can be different].

8. Unification is not possible by [uniting] one thing with that one thing, nor by [uniting]
one thing with a different thing;Thus, the becoming unified, the state of being united, and
the one who unites are not possible.
