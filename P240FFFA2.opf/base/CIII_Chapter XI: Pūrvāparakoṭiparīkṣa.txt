[Chapter] 11: An Analysis of the Past (purva) and Future Limits (aparakiti) of Existence] (samsara)1.
The great ascetic [Buddha] said: “The extreme limit (koti) of the past cannot be
discerned.”“Existence-in-flux” (samsara) is without bounds; indeed, there is no beginning
nor ending of that [existence].

2. How could there be a middle portion of that which has no “before” and “after”;It follows
that “past,” “future,” and “simultaneous events” do not obtain.Birth and death are not separate
/ different, not simultaneous / the same.

3. If birth [is regarded as] the former, and growing old and dying [are regarded as] coming
into being later,Then birth exists without growing old and dying, and [something] is born
without death.

4. If birth were later, and growing old and dying were earlier,How would there be an uncaused
growing old and dying of something unborn?

5. And a birth which is simultaneous with growing old and dying is likewise impossible;For,
that which is being born would die, and both would be without cause.

6. Since the past, future, and simultaneous activity do not originate,To what purpose [do you]
explain in detail [the existence of] birth, growing old and dying?

7. That which is produced and its cause, as well as the characteristic and that which is characterized,The
sensation and the one who senses, and whatever other things there are —

8. Not only is the former limit of existence-in-flux (samsara) not to be found,But the former
limit of all those things is not to be found.
