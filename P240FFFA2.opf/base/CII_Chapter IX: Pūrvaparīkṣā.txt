[Chapter] 9: An Analysis of “the Pre-existent Reality” (purva) (grasper and grasping)1. Certain
people say: Prior to seeing hearing, and other [sensory faculties] together with sensation
and other [mental phenomena]Is that to which they belong.

2. [They reason:] How will there be seeing, etc. of someone (i.e. as the subject seeing) who
does not exist?Therefore, there exists a definite (vyavasthita) entity before that [seeing,
etc.].

3. But that definite entity is previous to sight, hearing, etc., and sensation, etc —How can
that [entity] be known?

4. And if that [entity] is determined without sight [and other sensory faculties],Then, undoubtedly,
those [sensory faculties] will exist without that [entity].

5. Someone becomes manifest by something (i.e. like vision); something is manifest by someone.How
would someone exist without something? How would something exist without someone?

6. [The opponent admits:]Someone does not exist previous to (purva) sight and all the other
[faculties] together.[Rather,] he is manifested by any one of [them:] sight, etc., at any
one time.

7. [Nagarjuna answers:]But if nothing exists previous to sight and all the other [faculties]
together,How could that [being] exist individually before sight, etc.?

8. [Further,] if that [being] were the “seer,” that [being] were the “hearer,” that [being]
were the one who senses,Then one [being] would exist previous to each. Therefore, this [hypothesis]
is not logically justified.

9. On the other hand, if the “seer” were someone else, or the “hearer” were someone else, or
the one who senses were someone else,Then there would be a “hearers when there was already
a “seer,” and that would mean a multiplicity of “selves” (ātma).

10. In those elements (bhūta) from which seeing, hearing, etc., and sensation, etc., arise–Even
in those elements that [being] does not exist.

11. When he to whom seeing, hearing, etc., and feeling, etc. belong does not exist,Then certainly
they do not exist.

12. For him who does not exist previous to, at the same time, or after seeing, etc.The conception
“He exists,” “He does not exist,” is dissipated.
