[Chapter] 13: An Analysis of Conditioned Elements (samskara) (the real)1. A thing of which the
basic elements are deception is vain, as the glorious one said.All conditioned elements
(samskara) are things that have basic elements (dharma) which are deception; therefore, they
are vain.

2. “If that which has deceptive basic elements is vain, what is there which deceives?”This was
spoken by the glorious one to illuminate “emptiness.”

3. [An opponent says:]There is non-self-existence of things [since] a thing, by observation,
[becomes] something else. (i.e. impermanence)A thing without self-existence does not exist—due
to the emptiness of existing things.

4. If self-existence does not exist, whose “other-existence” would there be?.[Nagarjuna answers:]If
self-existence does exist, whose “other-existence” would there be?

5. Just as there is no other-existence of a thing, so also [an-other-existence] of something
else is not possible—Since a youth is not aging (jiryate), and since “who has already aged”
is not aging (jiryate).

6. If there would be an other-existence of a thing, milk would exist as curds.[But] surely “being
curds” will be something other than milk.

7. If something would be non-empty, something would [logically also] be emptyBut nothing is
non-empty, so how will it become empty?

8. Emptiness is proclaimed by the victorious one as the refutation of all viewpoints;But those
who hold “emptiness” as a viewpoint—[the true perceivers] have called those “incurable”
(asadhya).
