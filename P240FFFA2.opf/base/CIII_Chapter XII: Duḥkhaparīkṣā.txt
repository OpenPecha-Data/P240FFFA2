[Chapter] 12: An Analysis of Sorrow (dukkha) (suffering)1. Some say:Sorrow (dukkha) is produced
by oneself (i), or by another (ii), or by both [itself and another] (iii), or from no
cause at all (iv);But [to consider] that [sorrow (dukkha)] as what is produced is not possible.

2. If it were produced by itself (i.e. self-causation), it would not exist dependent on something
else.Certainly those “groups of universal elements” (skandhas) exist presupposing these
“groups.”

3. If these were different from those, or if those were different from these,Sorrow (dukkha)
would be produced by something other than itself (i.e. other-causation), because those would
be made by these others.

4. If sorrow (dukkha) is made through one’s own personality (i) (svapudgala), then one’s own
personality would be without sorrow (dukkha);Who is that “own personality” by which sorrow
(dukkha) is self-produced (i)?

5. If sorrow (dukkha) were produced by a different personality (ii) (parapudgala),How would
he, to whom is given that sorrow (dukkha) by another after he had produced it, be without
sorrow (dukkha)?

6. If sorrow (dukkha) is produced by a different personality, who is that different personalityWho,
while being without sorrow (dukkha), yet makes and transmits that [sorrow (dukkha)]
to the other?

7. It is not established that sorrow (dukkha) is self-produced (i), [but] how is [sorrow (dukkha)]
produced by another (ii)?Certainly the sorrow (dukkha), which would be produced by
another (ii), in his case would be self-produced (i’).

8. Sorrow (dukkha) is not self-produced (i), for that which is produced is certainly not produced
by that [personality].If the “other” (para) is not produced by the individual self (ātma),
how would sorrow (dukkha) be that produced by another?

9. Sorrow (dukkha) could be made by both [self and the “other”] (iii) if it could be produced
by either one.[But] not produced by another, and not self-produced (iv) —how can sorrow
(dukkha) exist without a caused

10. Not only are the four [causal] interpretations not possible in respect to sorrow (dukkha),[but
also] none of the four [causal] interpretations is possible even in respect to external
things (bhava).
