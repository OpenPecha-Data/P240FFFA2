[Chapter] 17: An Analysis of Action (karma) and Its Product (phala) (action and its results)1.
The state of mind which is self-disciplined, being favorably disposed toward others,And
friendship: that is the dharma; that is the seed for the fruit now and after death.

2. The most perceptive seer [Buddha] has said that there is action (karma) as volition and as
a result of having willed.The variety of acts of that [action] has been explained in many
ways.

3. Thus, that action which is called “volition”: that is considered [by tradition] as mental;But
that action which is a result of having willed: that is considered [by tradition] as
physical or verbal.

4. Sound (1), gesture (2) and that which does not rest which is considered as unknown (3),Also
the other unknown which is considered to be at rest (4);

5. That which is pure as a result of enjoyment (5), that which is impure as a result of enjoyment
(6),And volition (7): these seven basic elements (dharma) are considered [by the tradition]
as the modes of action.

6. If an action [exists] by enduring to the time of its fulfillment, that [action] would be
eternal.If [an action] were stopped—being stopped, what will it produce?

7. There is fruit (phala) when a process, a sprout, etc., starts from a seed;But without a seed
that [process] does not proceed.

8. Inasmuch as the process is dependent on a seed and the fruit is produced from the process,The
fruit, presupposing the seed, neither comes to an end nor is eternal.

9. There is a product (phala) when a mental process starts from a thoughts;But without a thought
that [process] does not proceed.

10. Inasmuch as the process is dependent on a thought and the product (phala) is produced from
the process,The product, presupposing the thought, neither comes to an end nor is eternal.

11. The ten pure “paths of action” are means for realizing the dharma.And the five qualities
of desired objects [i.e., desire to know the form, sound, odor, taste, and touch of existence]
are fruits (phala) of the dharma both now and after death.

12. There would be many great mistakes if that explanation [were accepted].Therefore, that explanation
is not possible.

13. In rebuttal I will explain the interpretation which can be made to fit [the facts],That
which is followed by the Buddha, the self-sufficient enlightened ones (pratyekabuddha) and
the disciples [of Buddha].

14. As “that which is imperishable” is like a credit [on an account statement], so an action
(karma) is like a debt.[The imperishable is] of four kinds in its elements (dhatu) [i.e.,
desire, form, non-form, and pure]; in its essential nature it cannot be analyzed.

15. [An imperishable force] is not destroyed qua destruction; rather it is destroyed according
to spiritual discipline.Therefore, the fruit of actions originates by the imperishable
force.

16. If [the imperishable force] were that which is destroyed by [usual] destruction or by transference
of action,Fallacies [like] the destruction of action would logically result.

17. At the moment of transition that [imperishable force]Of all identical and different actions
belonging to the same element (dhatu) originates.

18. That [imperishable force] is the dharma, having arisen by one action after another in visible
existence;And it remains [constant] even in the development of all bifurcating action.

19. That [imperishable force] is destroyed by death and by avoiding the product (phala) .There
the difference is characterized as impure and pure.

20. “Emptiness,” “no annihilation,” existence-in-flux, “non-eternity,”And the imperishable reality
of action: such was the teaching taught by the Buddha.

[Nagarjuna refutes the above arguments:]21. Why does the action not originate?Because it is
without self-existence.Since it does not originate, it does not perish.

22. If an action did exist as a self-existent thing, without a doubt, it would be eternal.An
action would be an unproduced thing; certainly, there is no eternal thing which is produced.

23. If the action were not produced, then there could be the fear attaining something from “something
not produced”;Then the opposite to a saintly discipline would follow as a fallacy.

24. Then, undoubtedly, all daily affairs would be precluded.And even the distinction between
saints and sinners is not possible.

25. Then an act whose development had taken place would develop again,If an act, because it
persists, exists through its own nature.

26. An action is that whose “self” (atman) is desire, and the desires do not really exist.If
these desires do not really exist, how would the action really exist?

27. Action and desire are declared to be the conditioning cause of the body.If action and desire
are empty, what need one say about “body”?

28. [An opponent tries to establish an identifiable entity by saying:]The man shrouded in ignorance,
and chained by craving (trsna)Is one who seeks enjoyment. He is not different from
the one who acts, nor identical to it.

29. [Nagarjuna answers:]Since action is not “originated presupposing the conditions” nor fails
to arise from presupposing the conditions,There is no one acting.

30. If there is no action, how could there be one who acts and the product of action?And if
there is no product, how can there be an enjoyer of the product?

31. Just as a teacher, by his magical power, formed a magical form,And this magical form formed
again another magical form—

32. Just so the “one who forms” is himself being formed magically; and the act performed by
himIs like a magical form being magically formed by another magical form.

33. Desires, actions, bodies, producers, and productsAre like a fairy castle, resembling a mirage,
a dream.
