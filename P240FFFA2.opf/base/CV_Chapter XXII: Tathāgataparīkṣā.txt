[Chapter] 22: An Analysis of the “Fully Completed” (Tathagata) (the Buddha)1. That one [who
is “fully-completed”] is not the “groups of universal elements” (skandha), nor something other
than the “groups”; the “groups” are not in him, nor is he in them;The “fully completed”
does not possess the “groups.”What, then, is the “fully completed”?

2. If the Buddha exists dependent on the “groups,” then he is not “that which exists by itself”
(svabbava)And how can he exist as something else (parabhava) (“other-existence”) if he
is not “that which exists by itself” (svabbava)?

3. That which exists presupposing another existent thing is properly called a “non-individual
self” (anatma).How will that which is a non-individual self become the “fully completed”?

4. And if there is no self-existence (svabhava), how would it have an “other-existence” (parabhava)?What
would that “fully completed” [reality] be without either a self-existence or
other-existence?

5. If some kind of “fully completed” [thing] would exist without dependence on the “groups,”It
is dependent now; therefore it exists dependent [on something].

6. There is no kind of “fully completed” [being] which is not dependent on the “groups.”And
whatever is not non-dependent—how will it become dependent?

7. There is nothing whatever that is dependent on [the “groups”] and there is no thing whatever
on which something does not depend.There would not exist in any way a “fully completed”
[being] without being dependent on [the “groups”].

8. That [fully completed being] which does not exist by its actual reality (tattva) or by some
other reality (anyatva) according to the five-fold examination—How is the “fully completed”
[being] perceived by being dependent?

9. So when there is dependence, self-existence does not exist;And if there is no self-existence
whatever, how is an other-existence possible?

10. Thus “dependence” and “that which is dependent” are completely empty (sunya).How is that
empty “fully completed one” known through that which is empty?

11. One may not say that there is “emptiness” (sunya) (1) nor that there is non-emptiness. (2)”Nor
that both [exist simultaneously] (3), nor that neither exists (4); the purpose for
saying [“emptiness”] is for the purpose of conveying knowledge.

12. How, then, will “eternity,” “non-eternity,” and [the rest of] the Tetralemma apply to bliss
(santa)?How, then, will “the end,” “without end,” and [the rest of] the Tetralemma apply
to bliss?

13. That image of nirvana [in which] the Buddha (Tathagata) either “is” or “is not”—By him who
[so imagines nirvana] the notion is crudely grasped.

14. Concerning that which is empty by its own nature (svabhava), the thoughts do not arise that:The
Buddha “exists” or “does not exist” after death.

15. Those who describe in detail the Buddha, who is unchanging and beyond all detailed description—Those,
completely defeated by description, do not perceive the “fully completed” [being].

16. The self-existence of the “fully completed” [being] is the self-existence of the world.The
“fully completed” [being] is without self-existence [and] the world is without self-existence.
